# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

**Project Title:** COVID-19 Global Data Tracker by Javan Meshack

## 📝 Project Description

In this project, I built a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The analysis covers cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across selected countries and over time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools. By the end, you’ll have a polished data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.
